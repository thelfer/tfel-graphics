# The `tfel-plot` project

The `tfel-plot` project is meant to create:

- a `C++11` library for generating `2D` plots.
- a drop-in replacement of `gnuplot` called `tplot`.

This project is based on:

- The [`TFEL` libraries](http://tfel.sourceforge.net).
- The [`Qt` framework](https://www.qt.io/) .

Compared to `gnuplot`, we wanted to introduced the following new
features:

- The ability to load `C` functions in shared libraries, such a the
  ones generated by the
  [`MFront` code generator](http://tfel.sourceforge.net).
- Usage of some features introduced by the `TFEL` project such as:
	- kriging interpolation.
	- the ability to differentiate functions.
- The ability to use `tplot` from the command line.
- Support for themes.

## Example of
